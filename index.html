              &emsp;Welcome to my very own web page that I am currently constructing using the knowledge I have gathered<br>
             from watching a 2 hour YouTube video for HTML for Beginners. It has been fun relearning what I had not<br>
              paid attention to during college and to be honest, it's been refreshing to do something else other than play<br>
              video games. I still have a long way to go as I want to learn Javascript, but CSS is what's next for me. Anyways,<br>
             enjoy the rest of the content that I will be working on here!
